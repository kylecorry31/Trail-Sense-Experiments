<h2 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5:  Fire</h2>
<p>This chapter discusses uses and principles of fire. It also describes how to construct a fire through different phases and using different construction methods to meet specific needs. The chapter closes with an in-depth discussion on fire-starting using manmade and primitive methods.  </p>
<h3>FIRE BASICS</h3>
<p>5-1. A properly constructed and utilized fire is one of the best tools an isolated person has. The use of fire supports several different survival needs and provides many other benefits. Fire-</p>
<li>Provides several ways to signal recovery forces with light and smoke and increases the isolated person's presence in the area with multiple well-placed fires. Fires allow personnel to multi-task while fire acts as a passive signal to recovery forces.</li>
<li>Provides a sustained source of heat that reduces energy required for the body to maintain its temperature. Consequently, isolated persons require fewer calories and less food.</li>
<li>Enables the most effective method of water purification, boiling.</li>
<li>Dries wet clothing and prevents cold injuries such as immersion foot, frostbite, and hypothermia.</li>
<li>Provides coals and flame to improvise tools.</li>
<li>Emits heat and smoke to preserve and cook food for consumption.</li>
<li>Repels mosquitos and dangerous animals.</li>
<li>Provides the requisite heat to sterilize items for medical purposes.</li>
<li>Boosts morale by providing comfort, peace of mind, entertainment, and companionship.</li>
<p>5-2. Fire is a very useful tool that will require knowledge of how to build, use, and maintain a fire under the most austere and inhospitable conditions. Fire is used with caution to prevent damage and injury to isolated persons and their surroundings.</p>
<p><b>FIRE BURNING PRINCIPLES</b></p>
<p>5-3. To build a fire, it helps to understand the following basic principles of a fire:</p>
<li>Fuel (in a nongaseous state) does not burn directly.</li>
<li>When heat is applied to a fuel, it produces a gas. This gas, combined with oxygen in the air, burns at a sustained rate as long as there is fuel to supply the gas.</li>
<li>Understanding the fire triangle is very important in constructing and maintaining a fire. The three sides of the triangle represent heat, oxygen, and fuel. If any of these are removed, the fire will go out. The correct ratio of these components is very important for a fire to burn at its greatest capacity (see figure 5-1 on page 5-2). Manipulating the structure of a poorly burning fire is an effective way to adjust the ratio of heat, oxygen, and fuel to reach a desired state.</li>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p><b>Figure 5-1. Fire triangle</b></p>
<p><b>SELECTING AND PREPARING A FIRE SITE</b></p>
<p>5-4. Determining a good site to build a fire is an often overlooked but important step in effectively using a fire. Isolated persons should select a site that provides a good foundation for building a fire and prepare it to support the isolated person's needs. Considerations include-</p>
<li>Terrain and climate.</li>
<li>Materials and tools available for fire building.</li>
<li>Time available for fire building.</li>
<li>Expected duration of isolation.</li>
<li>Purpose(s) for the fire.</li>
<li>Security risks that a fire may cause.</li>
<li>Requirement to direct heat in a desired direction.</li>
<p>5-5. Fire sites should meet the following basic criteria:</p>
<li>Flat, dry area to construct fire and accomplish fire-related activities.</li>
<li>Protected from the wind.</li>
<li>Located near isolated person's shelter or living area.</li>
<li>Near a fuel supply to maintain the fire.</li>
<li>Away from snow laden trees.</li>
<p>5-6. To prepare a fire site-</p>
<li>Clear the ground of fallen leaves, vegetation, and duff; expose 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter of soil at a minimum to prevent the fire from spreading along the ground.</li>
<li>Porous rock is removed from the fire site, which is at risk of exploding from the heat of the fire.</li>
<li>Level the area that the fire is to be constructed upon, if sloped, to prevent fuel from sliding off the fire.</li>
<li>In deep snow where the soil cannot be reached, green logs are used as a base to build the fire on to prevent the coals from melting a hole through the snow pack and away from isolated persons. In the cold green logs up to the size of a soda can are easily broken. Pieces are stacked in two layers, the top being perpendicular to the bottom to a size that contains the entirety of the intended fire.</li>
<li>Construct a fire reflector if desired; this task is more easily accomplished during the preparation phase before the fire becomes hot.</li>
<p><img src="55.webp" /></p>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p><b>FIRE REFLECTOR</b></p>
<p>5-7. Fire reflectors are used to maximize the heat produced from the fire by directing in a desired direction and protecting the heat from being displaced by the wind. Reflectors can be constructed of nonporous rock or stack of logs most effectively made of green wood (see figure 5-2). When located at the opening of a shelter, the heat is directed into the enclosure to elevate the temperature of the living area.</p>
<p><b>Figure 5-2. Types of firewalls </b></p>
<h3>BUILDING A FIRE</h3>
<p>5-8. Once the fire site is selected and prepared, the fire-building process can begin. The first step is to procure a base and a brace (see figure 5-3 on page 5-4) which are used to initially establish and control the fire. The base is a flat piece of material, usually wood or a nonporous rock (porous rocks contain water and, when heated, can explode). The base is used to keep moisture susceptible tinder and kindling off the wet ground and provides a clear area to skillfully ignite tinder. The brace is employed across the base to help control oxygen into either the tinder, kindling, or fuel being worked. It is about the size of a person's forearm. A broken branch can typically be found and employed as a brace.</p>
<p><img src="56.webp" /></p>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p><b>Figure 5-3. Base and brace</b></p>
<p>5-9. After preparing the base and brace, fuel is procured and prepared to start and maintain the fire. Fire building occurs across 3 phases. If one phase is skipped even in ideal circumstances, it is likely that the fire will fail due to not having the appropriate mix of oxygen, heat, and fuel. The 3 phases are tinder, kindling, and fuel, each representing an increase in fuel size appropriate for heat and oxygen available to support it. Figure 5-4 provides examples of tinder, kindling, and fuel.</p>
<p><b>Figure 5-4. Tinder and kindling examples</b></p>
<p><img src="57.webp" /></p>
<p><img src="58.webp" /></p>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p><b>TINDER</b></p>
<p>5-10. Tinder is used during the first phase of fire building. A dry material can be ignited by a small spark, coal, or flame. Tinder is normally comprised of fine fibers or is petroleum-based and is either natural or man- made. Isolated persons can procure natural tinder, when damp, and store it between layers of clothing to use heat radiated by the body to dry it prior to use. When using fibrous tinder to start a single fire, isolated persons collect enough to fill their hand with fingers cupped. Natural tinder examples include- <ul><li> Birch bark-shredded inner bark known as heartwood from cedar, chestnut, red elm trees. </li><li> Fine wood scrapings or shavings (heartwood preferred). </li><li> Dead dry grass, ferns, moss, lichen, and fungi. </li><li> Dry powdered sap from the pine tree family also known as pitch. </li><li> Fine pitch wood scrapings or shavings. </li><li> Crushed fibers from a dead plant. </li><li> Pine pitch globules mixed with fibrous material. </li><li> Seed down (milkweed, cattail, thistle). </li><li> Feather sticks (wood shavings cut into and still connected to a piece of wood).</li></ul></p>
<p>5-11. Manmade tinder examples include- <ul><li> Cotton balls (most effective when coated with a petroleum-based paste). </li><li> Lint. </li><li> Paper. </li><li> Foam rubber. </li><li> Hexamine. </li><li> Tryoxine. </li><li> Commercial petroleum-based pastes. </li><li> Steel wool. </li><li> Gunpowder. </li><li> Candle. </li><li> Solid-state fuel tabs.</li></ul></p>
<p>5-12. Isolated persons can procure natural tinder, when damp, and store it between layers of clothing to use heat radiated by the body to dry it prior to use. When using fibrous tinder to start a single fire, isolated persons collect enough to fill their patrol cap or their hand with fingers cupped at a minimum. A sufficient amount of tinder must be used to generate a hot enough flame to ignite kindling in the next phase of fire building. Smaller quantities of petroleum-based products are used as they burn much longer with a central burn point. To ignite some petroleum-based tinder such as tree sap, it may be necessary to combine it with some fibrous tinder to catch the flame for ignition.</p>
<p>5-13. Tinder is laid on a dry base to avoid the fine fibers from soaking up moisture and rendering it unusable. When laid on the base it rests up against the brace in a mound. The tinder is lighted from its bottom edge away from the brace. The initial flame is small and is most easily able to spread in an upward sloping direction creating a more reliable, quicker, and hotter flame to engulf the tinder and ignite kindling.</p>
<p><b>KINDLING</b></p>
<p>5-14. Kindling is the second phase of fire building. Kindling is added once the tinder is burning strong and mostly engulfed by flame. It is laid by the handful on, and perpendicular to, the top of the brace and over the burning tinder. It should be laid over the tinder fire so that some spaces are left in the kindling for the tinder fire to burn through. If the kindling is laid over the tinder like a blanket, the fire will likely not receive enough oxygen to continue burning, will not be able to ignite the kindling, and will die out. The second handful of kindling is laid perpendicular or diagonal to the first laid kindling to maintain small pockets for the fire to burn through and grow.</p>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p>5-15. Kindling has a high combustible point similar to tinder. The kindling phase is used to transition to large long burning fuel by increasing the size of the fire, and creating an initial coal base that increases heat output and the fire's longevity.</p>
<p>5-16. Examples of kindling include-</p>
<li>Dead, dry, small twigs and plant stalks; isolated persons should consider that during the winter months live deciduous vegetation that is dormant may appear dead. A quick check of the cambium layer-just under the bark-will indicate whether it is alive or dead.</li>
<li>Dead, dry, thinly shaved pieces of wood, bamboo, or cane (always split bamboo as sections can explode).</li>
<li>Dead coniferous needles.</li>
<li>Small branches low to the ground on the underside of coniferous trees that are dead from lack of sun (a single branch often has all three sizes of kindling on it that simply need to be broken down for use).</li>
<li>Some plastics such as the spoon from an in-flight ration.</li>
<li>Wood which has been soaked or doused with flammable materials; that is, wax, insect repellent, petroleum fuels, or oil.</li>
<li>Strips of petrolatum gauze from a first aid kit.</li>
<li>Pitch wood sticks.</li>
<li>Larger pieces of wood split into kindling-sized pieces.</li>
<p>5-17. The inner wood of dead branches and small diameter trees is the driest because it is not exposed to the weather. Wood that is split to expose the inner wood grains burns faster and hotter than wood pieces that are covered by bark which naturally protects trees from fire and collects moisture. Wood less than 3 inches in diameter and approximately 1 to 2 feet in length can easily be split using a strong fixed blade survival knife and a sturdy forearm sized branch. The branch is used to drive the knife down the length of the wood along the grain. Wood with the fewest knots is selected for splitting. The split is repeated until the desired size is reached.</p>
<p>5-18. The following method is used to split wood with a fixed blade survival knife:</p>
<li><b>Step 1.</b> Set the piece to be split upright on the ground, or on a sturdy base, and hold it in position.</li>
<li><b>Step 2.</b> In the non-primary hand, hold the knife, blade down, on the top of the wood piece, the tip should extend well past the edge of wood and slightly into the air so that the knife is at about a 60- degree angle to the wood piece.</li>
<li><b>Step 3.</b> Place pressure on the handle of the knife to ensure the blow of the branch onto the tip end of the knife drives the blade into the wood (if proper pressure is not applied the energy from the blow will instead result in popping the handle into the air)</li>
<li><b>Step 4.</b> Strike a blow with the branch against the tip end of the knife.</li>
<li><b>Step 5.</b> Repeat until the wood piece is split through; continue splitting each piece into smaller pieces to reach the desired size.</li>
<p>5-19. Preparing kindling in several different sizes that range from pencil lead, to pencil, and then to thumb size will make fire-building easy when laid over the tinder in that order. Kindling that is approximately 12 to 18 inches in length is the easiest to apply and manipulate when building a fire. Isolated persons collect at the very minimum; the diameter of a soda can of each size, to ensure enough kindling is available to increase the fire's heat to ignite the fuel in the next phase.</p>
<p><b>FUEL</b></p>
<p>5-20. Wood used as fuel should be the diameter of the forearm at a minimum. Wood is the most abundant source of fuel in most environments; however, there are many other types of fuel an isolated person can use. Unlike tinder and kindling, fire fuel does not have to be kept completely dry if the fire is established well enough to dry the damp fuel before burning. However, the more moisture fuel contains the more white smoke the fire will produced as it burns it off. The type of fuel will determine the amount of heat and light the fire produces. Dry, split hardwood trees (such as oak, hickory, and ash) are less likely to produce excessive smoke and provide more heat than softwoods (pine, spruce, and fir) due to their higher density. This density however</p>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p>makes them more difficult to break and split into usable pieces than softwood. Softwood burns faster and produces more smoke unless a large flame is maintained. They are often straight grained, have fewer knots, and are easy to split. </p>
<p>5-21. .Effective fuel sources include dry, standing, dead wood and dry, dead branches (those that snap when broken). Standing or leaning dead wood is usually dry even in rainy climates as its vertical position sheds most rain. In contrast, rotten wood, most of which is found lying directly on the ground, is of little use since it smolders and is very difficult to ignite. It produces a large amount of smoke, which can be useful in a signaling situation, but is a poor fuel.</p>
<p><b>Caution</b>. Highly flammable liquids should not be poured on an existing fire. Even a smoldering fire can cause liquids to explode and cause serious burns.</p>
<p>5-22. Dead wood is easy to split and break. It can be pounded on a rock or wedged between trees 2 to 3 feet apart, bending it until it breaks. A large survival knife can also be used to split the wood to reach the heartwood, which is typically the last to rot. As a last resort green wood, which is found almost anywhere, can be made to burn if finely split and mixed evenly with dry, dead wood. In extremely cold weather, moisture is pulled from green wood, which then becomes a viable fuel. Wood used as fuel must be free of poisonous plants such as poison ivy or poison oak. These plants can cause respiratory distress if burned and inhaled. In areas void of wood, other fuels can be used:</p>
<li>Dry grasses can be twisted into bunches.</li>
<li>Dry bamboo can be used as a fuel after it is split to open its sections; isolated persons must beware of large splitters.</li>
<li>Dead cactus and other plants are available in deserts.</li>
<li>Dry peat moss can be found along the surface of undercut stream banks and in dry swampy areas.</li>
<li>Dried animal dung, animal fats, and sometimes-even coal can be used as fuel if located.</li>
<li>Blubber from marine animals can be used as a fuel source.</li>
<li>Oil, diesel, gasoline, and other high-performance fuels can be used when mixed with sand to slow their burn rate and prolong their burn time. This makes them a safe fuel alternative.</li>
<li>Vehicle tires burn well but are difficult to ignite and may produce chemicals that should not be inhaled.</li>
<p><b>Caution.</b> Petroleum-based fuels will produce thick, black smoke when burned. Inhaled petroleum products can be harmful to the health and respiratory system of the isolated person. Do not prepare foods directly over petroleum-based fires due to the toxins produced. Ensure proper ventilation when utilizing these types of fuels.</p>
<p><b>Fire Lays</b></p>
<p>5-23. Isolated persons lay the fuel in a manner consistent with their purpose as listed in paragraph 5-1. A fire lay is a structure constructed by the manner in which fuel, typically wood, is placed to focus heat or flame, accommodate personnel, provide light, or use fuel. Selecting the correct fire lay to support specific tasks will make the fire a more effective and efficient tool. Commonly used fire lays include-</p>
<p><b>Tepee</b></p>
<p>5-24. Tepee fires are made by arranging the tinder and a few sticks of kindling in the shape of a tepee or cone. The center can be lighted after the structure is built or the structure can be built around a small fire. As the tepee burns, the outside logs will fall inward, feeding the fire. This type of fire burns well even with wet wood. (See figure 5-5 on page 5-9 for an example).</p>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p><b>Lean-to</b></p>
<p>5-25. Lean-to fires are constructed by pushing a green stick into the ground at a 30-degree angle. The end of the stick is pointed in the direction of the wind. Tinder is placed deep under the lean-to stick. Kindling is then placed against the lean-to stick. The tinder is then lighted. As the kindling catches fire from the tinder, more kindling and later fuel, is added. (See figure 5-5 on page 5-9 for an example).</p>
<p><b>Cross-ditch</b></p>
<p>5-26. Cross-ditch fires are constructed by digging an "X" about 12 inches in diameter, and 3 inches deep into the ground. Tinder is placed in the middle of the cross. A kindling pyramid is built above the tinder. The shallow ditch allows air to sweep under the tinder to provide a draft. (See figure 5-5 on page 5-9 for an example).</p>
<p><b>Pyramid </b></p>
<p>5-27. A pyramid fire is built by placing two small logs or branches parallel on the ground. A solid layer of small logs are then set across the parallel logs to make a platform. Three or four more layers of logs are added, each layer smaller than the last and perpendicular to the layer below it. A starter fire is then built on top of the pyramid. As the starter fire burns, it will ignite the logs below it. This creates a fire that burns downward, requiring no attention during the night. (See figure 5-5 on page 5-9 for an example).</p>
<p><b>Log Cabin </b></p>
<p>5-28. As the name implies, this lay looks similar to a log cabin. Log cabin fires are built by placing layers upon layers of perpendicular fuel wood. This fire creates a great amount of light and heat, primarily because of the amount of oxygen which enters the fire. The log cabin fire creates a quick and large bed of coals and can be used for cooking or as the basis for a signal fire.</p>
<p><b>Long Fire</b></p>
<p>5-29. The long fire can be made as a trench, the length of which is laid to take advantage of existing wind. It can also be built above ground by dragging two logs (green is better) parallel to each other to hold the coals together. These logs should be at least 6 inches in diameter and situated so cooking utensils can rest upon the logs. Two 1-inch-thick sticks can be placed under both logs, one at each end of the long fire. This is done to allow the coals to receive more air. Long fires allow larger groups of personnel near the heat and enable coals to be moved to one end for cooking with a fire at the other.</p>
<p><b>Star Fire</b></p>
<p>5-30. Star fires are built by placing wood pieces or logs in the shape of spokes in a wheel so that the inner ends burn in the fire. As the ends burn, the remaining fuel from each log is pulled closer to the fire. The star fire is used when conservation of fuel is necessary or a small fire is desired. It also allows isolated persons to use larger pieces of fuel that they can otherwise not break down into smaller pieces suitable for other fire lays. This fire must be constantly tended. Hardwood fuels work best for star fires.</p>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p><b>Figure 5-5. Fire lays</b></p>
<p>5-31. When completed with a fire it is extinguished using materials such as water, entrenching tools, dirt or sand, and sturdy sticks that are prepared in advance. A fire is extinguished by removing one of the fire triangle elements. Fires with nonpetroleum-based fuel can be extinguished with an adequate amount of water. Large pieces of burning wood can be separated and the coals can be raked off with a tree branch. Some burning fuel can be broken apart and scattered over bare soils. Dirt or sand works well to extinguish petroleum-based fires. Isolated persons may even be able to retrieve a chemical-based fire extinguisher from their aircraft or vehicle for this purpose.</p>
<h3>CAUTION.</h3>
<p>When leaving an area after having a fire, ensure that the ground under where the fire was built is cool to the touch. </p>
<h3>FIRE STARTING TECHNIQUES </h3>
<p>5-32. Fires are started from the upwind side to protect the fragile fire-starting heat source. Several different techniques can be used to ignite tinder. These techniques support either modern or primitive methods. Isolated persons determine the best technique to use after analyzing issued and natural resources available to start the fire. While primitive methods allow for greater flexibility since they can be improvised from the natural environment, they generally require more skill and time to execute. Modern methods are the quickest and easiest method to start a fire, but they can only start a certain number of fires until the resource is exhausted. However, some modern methods, such as a metal match, can be used hundreds to thousands of times over depending upon the skill of the user.</p>
<p><b>MODERN METHODS OF FIRE BUILDING</b></p>
<p>5-33. Modern fire-starters provide an advantage because they are specifically constructed for igniting fire, are durable, and their performance can be easily repeated. Other man-made devices can be used as an improvised fire-starter with minimal effort. Modern methods are often easier for injured isolated persons to utilize when their movement is limited. Modern fire-starters include are discussed in more detail in paragraphs 5-34-5-56.</p>
<p><img src="59.webp" /></p>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p><b>Matches</b></p>
<p>5-34. Ensure that these matches are waterproof, stored in a waterproof container, and have a striker pad. Isolated persons take intentional precautionary measures to protect lit matches from wind. Each match that fizzles out or is blown out by wind represents one fewer fire that the isolated person can start in the future. Matches can quickly become damp due to their size and exposed wood grain. When damp, their effectiveness is reduced causing them to burn weaker or not at all. Matches that have wax coated tips can be purchased commercially. Personnel can also dip the match heads in melted wax to protect them from moisture. Strike anywhere matches are the most adaptable.</p>
<p>5-35. To light a match the head is raked, with evenly applied pressure through the strike, over a rough surface compatible with the match type. Once the match head is ignited, it is held with the match head pointing down at an angle so the flame can begin to climb the matchstick and gain strength. It is critical that the flame is protected from the wind during this step. Once the initial flame gains strength, the match is held near the bottom edge of tinder to ignite it. Caution is used to avoid snuffing out the small match flame by placing it into or tightly against the tinder and smothering it. Lighters are used to ignite tinder similarly to matches.</p>
<p><b>Lighters</b></p>
<p>5-36. Lighters come in butane and liquid-lighter fuel types. These can be used for a direct and sustained flame to light the tinder. Butane lighters provide better wind resistance, and are a much hotter and more concentrated heat source than liquid fuel types. For these reasons, they are a better tool for starting a fire. However, liquid fuel types can last longer and create more fires if tinder is prepared properly. Under extreme cold temperatures, lighter fuel can freeze up and not function. In such situations, body heat can be used to warm the lighter. If the fuel runs out of a liquid-lighter, the sparking mechanism can be used similar to a metal match.</p>
<p><b>Metal Match</b></p>
<p>5-37. The metal match is the most useful and versatile issued survival fire-starter when personnel are trained in its effective use. However, quality varies between metal matches and affects how easily they spark, and how hot and long the sparks burn. Personnel should conduct operational tests of metal matches they purchase or are issued to ensure they are effective. Metal matches are reliable and not effected by wet or dry conditionals, cold or hot weather, evaporation or age, and do not malfunction. Metal matches should be protected from corrosion like all metal tools. They are limited only in that they require a piece of metal with a good edge, 90-degree is preferable, to produce hot sparks. Most commercial metal matches include a striker to do this, but the back of a fixed-blade knife, tang end of a folding knife blade, or other similar tool can also accomplish the task just as well.</p>
<p>5-38. Depending upon its size, the quality of the metal match, and the skill of the operator, a single match can start thousands of fires. Metal matches are made of the same type material used for flints in commercial cigarette lighters. Some also have magnesium strips attached that can be scraped into tinder to create a higher flash point to more easily ignite the tinder.</p>
<p>5-39. Holding the striker at a 90-degree angle against the stick typically produces the best sparks. Good sparks from a metal match burn hot, fast, and can compensate for some moisture in tinder. The following are instructions for using a metal match to start a fire:</p>
<li>Hold the stick in the non-primary hand and striker in the primary hand.</li>
<li>Grasping the stick at the top, place the bottom end of the stick firmly on or near the edge of tinder setting on a secure base.</li>
<li>Hold the edge of the striker at a 90-degree angle to the top of the stick.</li>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<li>Drive the striker downward with evenly applied pressure through the strike to near the bottom of the stick. This will throw a substantial amount of sparks into the tinder of done correctly.</li>
<li>Terminate the downward strike prior to the striker disturbing the tinder or recently thrown sparks to avoid snuffing them out. To avoid this, the far end of the striker (for example, the tip of a knife) can be slightly angled downward during the strike so that the tip stops the strike when it is driven into the base, rather than the entire flat side of a knife stamping out the sparks and disturbing the tinder.</li>
<p><b>Batteries</b></p>
<p>5-40. Batteries found in vehicles, aircraft, or electronic equipment can be used as a field-expedient fire- starter. Two insulated wires are required in addition to the battery to utilize this method. Once wire is connected to the positive post of the battery and the other wire is connected to the negative post. The two ends are touched to a third piece of uninsulated wire. (See figure 5-6). A short in the wire will result and cause a spark or a superheated piece of metal to ignite the tinder. Similarly, fine-grade steel wool can be stretched between the two posts of the battery causing the steel wool to heat up and produce a coal.</p>
<p><b>Figure 5-6. Starting a fire with a battery</b></p>
<p><b>Caution.</b> Isolated persons need to be careful to keep any open flame away from the battery. Certain batteries produce explosive hydrogen gases that could result in injury. </p>
<p><b>Convex Lens</b></p>
<p>5-41. Use this method only on bright, sunny days. The lens can come from binoculars, a camera, telescopic sights, or magnifying glasses. Angle the lens to concentrate the sun&apos;s rays on the tinder. (See Figure 5-7 on page 5-12). Hold the lens over the same spot until the tinder begins to smolder. Gently blow or fan the tinder into a flame.</p>
<p><img src="60.webp" /></p>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<p><b>Figure 5-7. Using a convex lens as a fire-starter</b></p>
<p><b>Flashlight Reflector</b></p>
<p>5-42. A flashlight reflector can be used to start a fire by placing the tinder in the center of the reflector where the bulbs are usually located. The tinder is pushed up from the back of the hole until the hotter light is concentrated on the end and smoke results. If a cigarette is, available it can be lit and the coal applied to tinder.</p>
<p><b>PRIMITIVE METHODS OF FIRE BUILDING</b></p>
<p>5-43. Primitive fire-starters are developed using the resources of the natural environment. They can be time consuming to construct and require greater energy, patience, and skill to learn in comparison to modern fire- starters. However, isolated persons that are unprepared or separated from their equipment can effectively use these methods to support survival tasks. Personnel that practice these skills before isolation are much more likely to be successful in constructing and using primitive fire-starters.</p>
<p><b>Flint and Steel</b></p>
<p>5-44. The type of rock most commonly used in fire starting is flint or any type of rock in the flint family such as quartz, chert, obsidian, agate, or jasper. Other stones may work. The main criteria are for a rock to be high in silica content and harder than steel. The direct-spark method is the easiest primitive method to use. Strike a flint or other hard, sharp-edged rock with a piece of carbon steel. Stainless steel does not produce a good spark. (See figure 5-8 on page 5-13). This method requires a loose-jointed wrist and practice. When the tinder catches a spark, blow on it. The spark will spread and burst into flames. Charred cloth is the preferred tinder for this method. The process for making charred cloth involves small pieces of cotton material, a small sealable metal container. Charred cloth can be made using the following instructions:</p>
<li>Place a nail-sized hole in the container lid.</li>
<li>Put cotton material loosely in layers inside the container and put the lid on.</li>
<li>Set the container near the edge of the fire on top of hot embers.</li>
<li>Once heated, smoke will penetrate the lid; an indication that the process is working.</li>

<p><b>Fire Plow</b></p>
<p>5-45. The fire plow is a friction method of ignition. (See figure 5-9). To use this method, cut a straight groove in a softwood base and plow the blunt tip of a hardwood shaft up and down the groove. The plowing action of the shaft pushes out small particles of wood fibers. As more pressure is applied on each stroke, the friction ignites the wood particles.</p>

<p><b>Bow and Drill</b></p>
<p>5-46. The bow and drill method is simple in concept but requires significant preparation initially. Isolated persons will need to improvise several parts including a socket, drill, fireboard, fire pan and bow from materials located in their nearby surroundings. Depending upon available resources, isolated persons may be able to use man-made resources to supplement natural materials in constructing a bow and drill.</p>

<p><b>Socket</b></p>
<p>5-47. A socket is an easily grasped stone or piece of hardwood with a slight depression in one side. The depression may need to be created. The depression in the socket is used to hold the top of the drill in place as it is rotated in the V-shaped cut of the fireboard. Soap or grease can be used in the socket to cut down on friction. Rock is the best material to build a socket. Alternatively, pitch wood and very hard wood types will last the longest as sockets before the top of the spindle wears through it. Soft woods can be used, but will need to be replaced more often.</p>
<p><b>Drill</b></p>
<p>5-48. The drill should be a straight, seasoned hardwood stick about 3/4 inch in diameter and 10 to 12 inches in length. The top end is rounded so it fits into the depression of the socket. The lower end is blunt so it will produce greater friction. Octagonal sides create greater friction than smooth sides when spinning. Drills that have a slight hourglass shape or groove in the middle will assist in keeping the bow in the middle of the drill and facilitate strokes that are more efficient. The isolated person should avoid any resinous woods as they will glaze over and hinder the process.</p>
<p><b>Fire Board</b></p>
<p>5-49. The fireboard should be a seasoned soft wood board. Examples of woods that work well as fireboards are yucca, tamarack, aspen, balsam fir, basswood, poplar, cypress, cottonwood, alder, red cedar, and willow. The fireboard should be about 1 inch thick and 4 inches wide. Cut a depression about 1/2 to 3/4 inches from the edge on one side of the board. On the underside of the fireboard, make a V-shaped cut from the edge of the board to the depression. The isolated person should avoid any resinous woods as they will glaze over and hinder the process.</p>
<p><b>Fire Pan</b></p>
<p>5-50. The fire pan can be thin bark, leather, or a flat plank of wood placed under the fireboard to catch the wood dust and coals produced from the drill. Once a coal has formed, the fire pan can be picked up with one hand to transfer the coal to the tinder bundle in the other hand. The fire pan also acts as a base to protect the fireboard ground moisture.</p>
<p><b>Bow</b></p>
<p>5-51. The bow should be a strong, green stick about 3/4 inch in diameter with a length of about three feet that should extend long enough to go from the isolated persons finger tips to their shoulder. The stick should be flexible enough to bend into a bow, appearing similar a bow used to shoot arrows. The type of wood is not important, but must be strong. The bowstring can be made from some type of cordage or leather. The cordage is tied from one end of the bow to the other, without any slack. When in use, the bowstring is twisted around the drill once to rotate it as it spins or drills into the fireboard producing the friction needed to create a coal.</p>
<p><b>Tinder</b></p>
<p>5-52. Tinder used for a bow and drill fire must be very dry, fine fibrous material made into the shape of a birds nest. Grass, liken, cotton, cattail duff, or cedar bark torn into small fibers is preferred. A large amount of completely dry tinder should be collected and prepared on a dry base near the fire site and the bow and drill operation to quickly transition a coal from the fireboard to the tinder when ready.</p>
<p><b>Operating a Bow and Drill </b></p>
<p>5-53. The base, brace, tinder, and kindling are prepared prior to operating a bow and drill. The tinder is placed near the fireboard on a base to keep it from ground moisture. The following steps are taken to operate a bow and drill fire-starter (see figure 5-10 on page 5-15):</p>
<li>If right-handed, the isolated person the left foot on the fireboard to secure it in place and the right knee on the ground.</li>
</div>
<div id="page0">
<li>One turn of the bowstring is made over the center of the drill.</li>
<li>The bottom of the drill is placed in the fireboard notch and the tip is placed in the socket held by the left hand.</li>
<li>The isolated person applies pressure on the drill from the socket and makes long, smooth strokes of the bow at a steady moderate speed; each stroke makes full use of the available string as longer strokes produce better friction.</li>
<li>Once a coal is produced in the mound of black wood dust on the fire pan, it begins to lightly smoke, at which time the fireboard is removed and the bird nest shaped tinder is place over the coal.</li>
<li>The fire pan and bird nest are then both flipped so the bird nest is on the bottom and fire pan is on top, and the fire pan is then removed.</li>
<li>The bird nest is then lightly closed around the coal and lightly waved through the air or lightly blown on with long steady breaths to heat the coal and surrounding tinder.</li>
<li>The amount of smoke coming from the inside of the bird's nest will continue to increase until it bursts into flame, at which time it is placed on the base where kindling is added.</li>

<p><b>Hand Drill</b></p>
<p>5-54. A hand drill is a simpler method than the bow and drill in that it requires less preparation. However, its operation is more difficult for some. The lower rate of rotation between the hands makes easy to use in hot and dry climates where the wood is very dry. The drill can be made of dried yucca, elderberry, and other similar wood. The fireboard is constructed of the same materials and dimensions as the one used for bow and drill fires. To operate a hand drill, pressure is applied to the top of the drill while rotating the hands to spin it in short bursts equal to the length of the hands. The hands will gradually slip down the length of the spindle. (See figure 5-11 on page 5-16). When near the bottom of the drill, the hands are repositioned and the action is repeated.</p>

<p><b>FIRE BUNDLE</b></p>
<p>5-55. Isolated persons may need to move to meet their needs. When they do, transporting coals from a previous fire with them may be the easiest method to start a new fire. Doing so will also conserve potentially limited fire-starting resources. This can be accomplished by constructing a fire bundle to carry smoldering embers. A tin can, animal horn, hardwood box, and birch bark pouch can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>5-56. Embers carried in a well-built fire bundle can last for several days. For example a fire bundle built from birch bark can be constructed by laying out a large piece of bark flat, adding a layer of wet material, then rotten wood. The coals are placed in the rotten wood and the bundle is rolled shut. (See figure 5-12 on page 5-17). The bundle should be checked occasionally to maintain the coals and ensure enough oxygen reaches them to prevent them from being extinguished.</p>
