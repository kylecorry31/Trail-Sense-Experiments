## Chapter 8: Survival Equipment

This chapter discusses the employment and maintenance of survival equipment and construction of field expedient weapons. Weapons serve a dual purpose. They are used to collect and prepare food and to provide for self\-defense. 

### MAINTAINING EQUIPMENT

8\-1\. Temperature extremes, both hot or cold, are stressful on equipment and can impede their use. For example, electronics require batteries, which have a limited amount of stored energy. Radios, GPSs, flashlights, cell phones, beacons, and blue\-force trackers need battery power to function. If exposed to temperature extremes, a battery's power can be degraded and internal parts can become damaged. This could leave isolated persons stranded during critical times when the equipment in needed. Extreme heat can cause batteries to overheat and potentially explode or degrade the stored\-up energy. Batteries should be kept out of direct sunlight and away from the open flame of any fire.

**PROTECTION**

8\-2\. In extreme cold weather, electronic equipment and spare batteries should be kept between layers of clothing to stay warm or in shelters out of the cold. Moisture has damaging effects on all types of equipment, and isolated persons should do everything possible to keep their items dry. Humidity encourages mold in enclosed spaces such as optics. Items such as optics should be kept in as dry a condition as possible so condensation does not form inside the sealed compartments. If the equipment becomes wet, it should be opened up and dried out thoroughly. Metal items can rust and moving parts will need lubrication if equipment is not completely dried. Metal items should be cleaned and lightly lubricated when not required for immediate use.

**LUBRICANTS AND GLUE**

8\-3\. Animal fat can be used as a lubricant and fuel for an improvised lamp or heater. A strong glue can be made that is perfect for gluing organic material together. It is made by boiling animal hide scrapings or rawhide until it dissolves into a thin liquid. This glue must be used while it is hot, as this type of glue will set quickly upon cooling. This type of glue will stretch if it gets wet and it will break down if it is exposed to high heat.

8\-4\. Plants that produce sap, mainly conifers like pine and spruce trees, can produce a glue that is waterproof. The sap from these trees is found as blisters of tree resin on the trunk and will also collect near wounds in the bark of the tree. These resin accumulations can be collected and placed in a container and cooked down over a fire. Once the material starts to melt the isolated person will notice a turpentine smell. Do not allow the resin to boil because this will weaken the product. The resin should be covered as it is cooked down because it is highly flammable.

8\-5\. Once the liquid glue is cooked down, it should be filtered to remove large impurities. The isolated person should add some type of tempering material. Tempering material makes the glue stronger and more stable. Types of tempering material are charcoal from the fire, beeswax, and animal scat from herbivores like rabbits or deer. For the right amount of tempering material to add, mix in a small amount, test the glue if it is sticky and soft, then add more material till it thickens to the desired consistency. The final product should be separated in usable portions and stored until needed for a project.

8\-6\. To use the glue, heat the glue and apply it to the surface of the project with a stick. Heating the project's surface before gluing or repairing the joint of the project increases the effectiveness and strength of the glue joint.

### FIELD\-EXPEDIENT WEAPONS

8\-7\. In survival situations, you may have to fashion any number and type of field\-expedient tools and equipment to survive

**IMPROVISING**

8\-8\. The need for an item must outweigh the work involved in making it. Follow these simple principles when improvising:

- Is it necessary or just nice to have?

- Determine the actual need.

- Inventory possessions and available natural and manmade resources.

- Consider all alternatives.

- Select the alternative providing the most efficient use of materials, time, and energy.

- Plan all construction to ensure that it is durable and safe.

**STAFFS**

8\-9\. A staff should be one of the first tools obtained. For walking, it provides support and helps in ascending and descending steep slopes. It also provides some weapons capabilities if used properly, especially against snakes and dogs. A staff should be about the same height as the person using it or at least eyebrow height. It should be no larger than the isolated person can effectively wield when tired and undernourished. A staff provides invaluable eye protection wheaten moving through heavy brush and thorns in darkness. It can also be used for self\-protection by thrusting, striking, and blocking potential threats.

**CLUBS**

8\-10\. Clubs should be held, but never be thrown. However, a club can extend the isolated person's area of defense beyond their fingertips. It also serves to increase the force of a blow without injuring the isolated person. The three basic types of clubs are explained as follows:

**Simple club**

8\-11\. A simple club is a staff or branch. It must be short enough to swing easily, but long enough and strong enough to damage whatever it hits. Its diameter should fit comfortably in the palm, but it should not be so thin as to allow the club to break easily upon impact. A straight\-grained hardwood is best, if available. A club is lightweight and effective as an impact weapon and can be swung at different angles to strike and block potential threats.

**Weighted club**

8\-12\. A weighted club is any simple club with a weight on one end. The weight may be a natural weight, such as a knot on the wood, or something added, such as a stone lashed to the club. To make a weighted club, first find a stone that has a shape that will allow easy lashing, securely to the club. A stone with a slight hourglass shape works well. If a suitably shaped stone cannot be found, fashion a groove or channel into the stone by "pecking," or repeatedly rapping the club stone with a smaller hard stone.

8\-13\. Next, find a piece of wood that is the right length, again straight\-grained hardwood is best. The length of the wood should feel comfortable in relation to the weight of the stone. Finally, lash the stone to the handle using a technique shown in figure 8\-1, on page 8\-3\. The technique used will depend on the type of handle chosen.

**Figure 8\-1\. Weighted clubs**

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/108.webp)

**Sling club**

8\-14\. A sling club is another type of weighted club. A weight hangs 3 to 4 inches from the handle by a strong, flexible lashing. This type of club both extends the user's reach and multiplies the force of the blow (see figure 8\-2, page 8\-4\).

**Figure 8\-2\. Sling club**

**EDGED WEAPONS**

8\-15\. Knives, spear blades, and arrow points fall under the category of edged weapons. The following paragraphs explain how to make such weapons.

**Knives**

8\-16\. A knife has three basic functions. It can puncture, slash or chop, and cut. A knife is also an invaluable tool used to construct other survival items. During isolation, you may find yourself without a knife or you may need another type knife or a spear. To improvise you can use stone, bone, wood, or metal to make a knife or spear blade.

***Stone***

8\-17\. A stone blade will make a good puncturing tool and a good chopping tool but will not hold a fine edge (see figure 8\-3, page 8\-5\). Some stones such as obsidian, chert, or flint can have very fine edges. To make a stone knife, a sharp\-edged piece of stone, a chipping tool, and a flaking tool will be needed. A chipping tool is a light, blunt\-edged tool used to break off small pieces of stone. A flaking tool is a pointed tool used to break off thin, flattened pieces of stone. A chipping tool can be made from wood, bone, or metal and a flaking tool can be made from bone, antler tines, or soft iron.

8\-18\. To make a stone blade, begin by roughing out the desired shape on the sharp piece of stone, using the chipping tool. Try to make the knife thin. Press the flaking tool against the edges. This action will cause flakes to come off the opposite side of the edge, leaving a razor\-sharp edge. Use the flaking tool along the

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/109.webp)

entire length of the edge to be sharpened. Eventually, this will produce a very sharp cutting edge that can be used as a knife. Lash the blade to some type of hilt. 

**Figure 8\-3\. Stone knife**

***Bone***

8\-19\. Bone can be used as an effective field\-expedient edged weapon when used only to puncture. It will not hold an edge and it may flake or break if used differently. To make a bone blade, begin by selecting a suitable bone. Larger bones, such as the leg bone of a deer or another medium\-sized animal, are best. Lay the bone upon another hard object. Shatter the bone by hitting it with a heavy object, such as a rock. From the pieces, select a suitable pointed splinter. Further shape and sharpen this splinter by rubbing it on a rough\-surfaced rock. If the piece is too small to handle, add a handle to it. Select a suitable piece of hardwood for a handle and lash the bone splinter securely to it.

***Wood***

8\-20\. Field\-expedient edged weapons made from wood, should be used only to puncture. Bamboo is the only wood that will hold a suitable edge. To make an edged tool from wood, begin by selecting a straight\-grained piece of hardwood that is about 12 inches long and 1 inch in diameter. Fashion the blade about 6 inches long, and shave it down to a point. Use only the straight\-grained portions of the wood. Do not use the core or pith, as it makes a weak point. Harden the point by a process known as fire hardening. If a fire is possible, dry the blade portion over the fire slowly until lightly charred; the drier the wood, the harder the point. After lightly

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/110.webp)

charring the blade portion, sharpen it on a coarse stone. If using bamboo and after fashioning the blade, remove any other wood to make the blade thinner from the inside portion of the bamboo. Removal is done this way because bamboo's hardest part is its outer layer. Keep as much of this layer as possible to ensure the hardest blade possible. When charring bamboo over a fire, char only the inside wood; do not char the outside.

***Metal***

8\-21\. Metal is best for making field\-expedient edged weapons. Metal, when properly designed, can fulfill a knife's three uses\-puncture, slice or chop, and cut. To make an edged weapon from metal, begin by selecting a suitable piece of metal, one that most resembles the desired product. Rub the metal on a rough\-surfaced stone to obtain a point and cutting edge. Use a suitable flat, hard surface as an anvil and a smaller, harder object of stone or metal to hammer out the edge. If the metal is soft enough, an edge can be hammered out while the metal is cold. Make a knife handle from wood, bone, or other material that will protect your hand.

***Other materials***

8\-22\. Other materials can be used to produce edged weapons. Glass is a good alternative to an edged weapon or tool if no other material is available. Obtain a suitable piece in the same manner as described for bone. Glass has a natural edge but is less durable for heavy work. Plastic can also be sharpened\-if it is thick enough or hard enough\-into a durable point for puncturing.

**Spear Blades**

8\-23\. To make a spear blade, use the same procedures to make the blade that are used to make a knife blade. Then select a shaft (a straight sapling) 4 to 5 feet long. The length should allow the ability to handle the spear easily and effectively. Attach the spear blade to the shaft using lashing. The preferred method is to split the handle, insert the blade, then wrap or lash it tightly (see figure 8\-4\).

**Figure 8\-4\. Bamboo for spears**

8\-24\. To make a spear without adding a blade, select a 4\- to 5\-foot long straight hardwood shaft and shave one end to a point. If possible, fire\-harden the point. Bamboo makes an excellent spear. Starting 3 to 4 inches back from the end used as the point, shave down the end at a 45\-degree angle. Remember, to sharpen the edges, shave only the inner portion.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/111.webp)

**Arrow Points**

8\-25\. To make an arrow point, use the same procedures as for making a stone knife blade. Chert, obsidian, flint, and shell\-type stones are best for arrow points; broken glass also makes an effective arrow point. Isolated persons can fashion bone like stone by flaking.

**OTHER EXPEDIENT WEAPONS**

8\-26\. Other field\-expedient weapons can be made including the throwing stick, archery equipment, bola, sling, slingshot, and sap. The following paragraphs explain how to make these weapons.

**Throwing Stick**

8\-27\. The throwing stick, commonly known as the rabbit stick, is very effective against small game (squirrels, chipmunks, and rabbits); however, isolated persons must practice the throwing technique for accuracy and speed. The rabbit stick itself is a blunt stick, naturally curved at about a 45\-degree angle (see figure 8\-5\).

8\-28\. Select a stick with the desired angle from heavy hardwood such as oak. Shave off two opposite sides so that the stick is flat like a boomerang. To use the throwing stick, first align the target by extending the non\-throwing arm in line with the mid\- to lower\-section of the target. Slowly and repeatedly raise the throwing arm up and back until the throwing stick crosses the back at about a 45\-degree angle or is in line with the non\-throwing hip. Bring the throwing arm forward until it is slightly above and parallel to the non\- throwing arm. This will be the throwing stick's release point. This method should be practiced repeatedly to attain accuracy.

**Figure 8\-5\. Throwing stick**

**Archery Equipment**

8\-29\. To make a bow, select a hardwood stick about three feet long that is free of knots or limbs. Carefully scrape the large end down until it has the same pull as the small end. Careful examination will show the natural curve of the stick. Always scrape from the side that faces you or the bow will break the first time it is pulled. Dead, dry wood is preferable to green wood. To increase the pull, lash a second bow to the first, front to front, forming an "X" when viewed from the side. Attach the tips of the bows with cordage and only use a bowstring on one bow. (See figure 8\-6 on page 8\-8\.)

8\-30\. Select arrows from the straightest dry sticks available. The arrows should be about half as long as the bow. Scrape each shaft smooth all around. You will probably have to straighten the shaft. You can bend an arrow straight by heating the shaft over hot coals. Do not allow the shaft to scorch or burn. Hold the shaft straight until it cools.

8\-31\. You can make arrowheads from bone, glass, metal, or pieces of rock. You can also sharpen and fire\- harden the end of the shaft. Fire hardening is actually a misnomer. To fire\-harden wood, hold it over hot coals

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/112.webp)

or plunge it deep under the coals in the ashes, being careful not to burn or scorch the wood. The purpose of fire hardening is to harden the wood by drying the moisture out of it.

8\-32\. You must notch the ends of the arrows for the bowstring. Cut or file the notch; do not split it. Fletching (adding feathers to the notched end of an arrow) improves the arrow's flight characteristics. Fletching is recommended but not necessary on a field\-expedient arrow.

8\-33\. While it may be relatively simple to make a bow and arrow, it requires considerable practice to attain proficiency at hitting a target.

**Figure 8\-6\. Archery equipment (bow)**

**Bola** 

8\-34\. The bola is another field\-expedient weapon that is easy to make (see figure 8\-7 on page 8\-9\). It is especially effective for capturing running game or low\-flying fowl in a flock. To use the bola, hold it by the center knot and twirl it above their head, then release the knot so that the bola flies toward the target. When the bola is released, the weighted cords will separate. These cords will wrap around and immobilize the fowl or animal it hits.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/113.webp)

**Figure 8\-7\. Bola**

**Sling**

8\-35\. Make a sling by tying two pieces of cordage, each about 60 centimeters (24 inches) long, at opposite ends of a palm\-sized piece of leather or cloth. Place a rock in the cloth, wrap one cord around your middle finger, and hold in your palm. Hold the other cord between your forefingers and thumb. To throw the rock, spin the sling several times in a circle and release the cord between your thumb and forefinger. Practice to gain proficiency. The sling is very effective against small game.

**Sling Shot**

8\-36\. To make a sling shot, find a Y in a green tree branch, then take some surgical tubing and tie it off at the tips of the Y. Then use a small piece of material to make the ammo seat and tie it off to the other end of the surgical tubing. Small rocks can be used for sling shot ammunition.

**Sapp** 

8\-37\. A sapp is made by filling a sock part way with rocks or other heavy material (metal, batteries, lock, etc.). Use the Sapp like a weighted club.

### CORDAGE AND LASHING

8\-38\. Many materials are strong enough to use as cordage and lashing, and a number of natural and manmade materials are available in a survival situation. For example, you can make a cotton web belt much more useful by unraveling it. You can then use the string for other purposes such as fishing line, thread for sewing, and lashing. Isolated persons can also use several strands of parachute cord and twist or braid them together to make a rope (see figure 8\-8 on page 8\-10\). Sheets are used in the same fashion. The parachute cord can be broken down into its components of the outer cover and the inner core strands for other purposes such as fishing line, thread for sewing, and lashing.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/114.webp)

**Figure 8\-8\. Making cordage**

**NATURAL CORDAGE SELECTION**

8\-39\. Before making cordage, conduct a few simple tests to determine the material's suitability. First, pull on a length of the material to test for strength. Next, twist it between your fingers and roll the fibers together. If it withstands this handling and does not snap apart, then tie an overhand knot with the fibers and gently tighten. If the knot does not break, it will work.

**Lashing Material**

8\-40\. Sinew is the best natural material for lashing small objects. Sinew can be obtained from the tendons of large game such as deer. Remove the tendons from the game and dry them completely. Smash the dried tendons so that they separate into fibers. Moisten the fibers and twist them into a continuous strand. If stronger lashing material is needed, the strands can be braided. When sinew is used for small lashings, they do not need knots as the moistened sinew is sticky and it hardens when dry. Another lashing material can be fibers from the inner bark of some trees, such as the linden, elm, hickory, white oak, mulberry, chestnut, and red and white cedar, to make cord. Isolated persons should test the cord to be sure it is strong enough for their purpose. These materials can be made stronger by braiding several strands together.

8\-41\. Rawhide can be used for larger lashing jobs. Make rawhide from the skins of medium or large game. After skinning the animal, remove any excess fat and any pieces of meat from the skin. Dry the skin completely. It does not need to be stretched as long as there are no folds to trap moisture, and the hair does not have to be removed from the skin. Cut the skin while it is dry. Make cuts about 1/4 inch wide. Start from the center of the hide and make one continuous circular cut, working clockwise to the hide's outer edge. Soak the rawhide for 2 to 4 hours or until it is soft. Use it wet, stretching it as much as possible while applying it. It will be strong and durable when it dries.

**Rucksack Construction**

8\-42\. The materials for constructing a rucksack or pack are almost limitless. Wood, bamboo, rope, plant fiber, clothing, animal skins, canvas, poncho, EVC, and many other materials are used to make a pack. There are several construction techniques for rucksacks. Many are very elaborate, but those that are simple and easy are often the most readily made in a survival situation. Two types of simple to construct packs are the\-

- **Horseshoe pack**. This pack is simple to make and use and relatively comfortable to carry over one shoulder. Lay available square\-shaped material, such as a poncho, a blanket, or canvas, flat

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/115.webp)

on the ground. Lay items on one edge of the material. Pad the hard items. Roll the material (with the items) toward the opposite edge and tie both ends securely. Add extra ties along the length of the bundle. The pack can be draped over one shoulder with a line connecting the two ends (see figure 8\-9\).

**Figure 8\-9\. Horseshoe pack**

- **Square pack**. This pack is easy to construct if rope or cordage are available. Otherwise, make the cordage first. To make this pack, construct a square frame from bamboo, limbs, or sticks. Size will vary for each person and the amount of equipment carried (see figure 8\-10\).

**Figure 8\-10\. Square pack**

**COOKING AND EATING UTENSILS**

8\-43\. There are many materials to make equipment for cooking, eating, and storing food. Usually all materials can serve some purpose when in a survival situation.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/116.webp)

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/117.webp)

**Bowls**

8\-44\. Use wood, bone, horn, bark, or other similar material to make bowls. To make wooden bowls, use a hollowed out piece of wood that will hold food and enough water to cook. Hang the wooden container over the fire and add hot rocks to the water and food. Remove the rocks as they cool and add more hot rocks until the food is cooked.

**CAUTION**

Do not use rocks with air pockets, such as limestone and sandstone. They may explode while heating in the fire.

8\-45\. This method can also be used with containers made of bark or leaves. However, these containers will burn above the waterline unless they are kept or the fire is kept low. A section of bamboo also works very well for cooking. Cut out a section between two sealed joints.

**CAUTION**

A sealed section of bamboo will explode if heated because of trapped air and water in the section.

**Forks, Knives, Spoons, and Chopsticks**

8\-46\. Carve forks, knives, and spoons from no resinous woods so that there is no wood resin aftertaste or the food is not tainted. Non\-resinous woods include oak, birch, and other hardwood trees.

Note. Do not use trees that secrete a syrup or resin\-like liquid on the bark or when cut.

**Pots**

8\-47\. Pots can be made from turtle shells or wood. As described with bowls, using hot rocks in a hollowed out piece of wood is very effective. Bamboo is the best wood for making cooking containers. To use turtle shells, first thoroughly boil the upper portion of the shell, then use it to heat food and water over a flame (see figure 8\-11 on page 8\-13\).

**Figure 8\-11\. Containers for boiling food**

**Improvising Pottery** 

8\-48\. Pottery has been used in most all areas of the world for storage vessels and cooking pots, plates and bowls. The process for making pottery in a survival situation involves finding a source of clay. Clay is formed through a process of withering granite rock. The isolated person should find clay that is as pure as they can get. The best clay is found near the bends of streams and rivers, where the finest of clay particles usually settle. The isolated person should dig up a portion of clay to be used in the project. The clay will then be left out to dry and made into a powder so the stones and other impurities can be sifted out.

8\-49\. Once the clay is sifted and turned into a fine powder the isolated person should add in some tempering material to strengthen it. Items for tempering clay include ground up seashells, sand, ground up eggshells and other crushed up pottery that has already been fired. Tempering the clay will keep it from shrinking during the firing process and keep it from cracking.

8\-50\. After the clay powder is tempered, water can be added to the mix and it can be kneaded to remove all of the air from the mixture. If any air is trapped in the clay, it will expand causing a break when it is fired.

8\-51\. Perform this process right before you are ready to form the clay. The proper consistency of clay is soft enough to form but firm enough that it will not stick to the fingers. Once the clay reaches the desired consistency the clay can be made into plates, bowls, pots, and other containers. Once the clay is formed into shape it should be left out to dry for several days. Once the clay project is dry rub it with a stone to close any open pours, sealing it and making it water tight, this is known as burnishing the clay.

8\-52\. Firing dried pottery items makes them more durable. For an improvised clay project made in the field the temperatures will be very low so the items will deteriorate over time but the isolated person should get plenty of use from them and are easily replaceable if they breakdown. To fire the clay cover the item with a thick layer of soil and build a fire on top of it, or build a fire around the outer edge of the item. Ensure not to let the flames touch the project at first and that it heats up slowly over time. Move the fire in closer until it is immersed in the fire and cooking at a high temperature for three to four hours. Take out after it's cooled off, clean it, and use as necessary for cooking, water, and food storage.

![](file:///android_asset/survival_guide/118.webp)

**Water Containers** 

8\-53\. Make water bottles from the stomachs of larger animals. Thoroughly flush the stomach out with water, and then tie off the bottom. Leave the top open, with some means of fastening it closed. Other items that can be used to hold water include non\-lubricated prophylactics and plastic bags.

**Weaving a Basket**

8\-54\. Baskets can be weaved to provide for useful applications such as storage of materials, like food water or other materials needing organization, protection and portability. Baskets can also make great fish traps. Baskets are loosely woven so they are excellent for storing food that needs air so that it does not spoil, like wild plants and berries. Many different materials can be used to weave a basket as long as they are flexible. Materials like shoots from a willow or hazel tree, pine or spruce roots, as well as different types of plants and grasses that can be made into cordage. The size of the basket is determined by the items needing to be stored in them.

8\-55\. To make a basket the isolated person should start with six flexible sticks cut to size to make the ribs or frame work of the basket. Take the six ribs and divide them into two bundles of three. Make a cross three on top of three. Secure the center of the cross with the material the basket is to be weaved out of with three strands of weaving material and a knot. Creating the base of the basket involves spreading the cross into six ribs and alternately weaving the three strands of material up and over one rib then under the next rib all the way around the circle until the base is the desired size. Once this is complete, the sides of the basket can be made by bending the ribs up. Making a small slit in the rib before bending will keep it flexible and keep it from breaking.

8\-56\. The sides of the basket are constructed by continuing to alternate the pattern using the three strands. If a strand of material runs short or breaks the isolated person can splice in a new piece of material by making a small twist from the end of the old piece to the end of the new piece and weave it in the same pattern and direction as the old strand. Once the basket has reached the desired height, then the ends of the weaving material should be tucked in and the ends of the basket ribs trimmed to size.
